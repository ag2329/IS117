                        <h3>The Battle</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>The war between the Pandavas and Kauravas lasted for 18 days.The battle during all the 18 days was pretty much the same and it would be futile to describe it day by day.The war which took place in Kurukshetra was one of the bloodiest to have occured in Ancient India. The Pandavas emerged victorious in the end but it only after they had lost most of their loved ones.Now let us have a look at how Bhishma,Abhimanyu,Drona,Karna and Duryodhana met their ends since the death of these characters form a major part of the narrative and are central to the understanding of the great epic.</p>

                        <h3>Bhishma’s Death</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>Bhishma commanded the Kauravas for the first 9 days brilliantly.Hence,the Pandavas were desperate to see his end. Bhishma,the grandsire,was in particular averse to the idea of fighting women on the battlefield.Krishna knew of this and, hence on tenth day,placed Sikhadin ,a transvestite, in front of Arjuna.Krishna then told Arjuna to aim arrows at the weak-points of Bhishma’s armour.Bhishma,on seeing Sikhadin before him,had naturally cast aside his weapons.It was then that Arjuna’s well-aimed shafts pierced the body of the grand-sire and he fell mortally wounded.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Another character ,who was killed by unfair means, was killed by unfair means was Abhimanyu.Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna and Subhadra,Krishna’s sister.When Abhimanyu was young his father had taught him how to breach the lotus formation and enter the enemy’s ranks.But he was inept at making his way out of the formation .Thus,when Arjuna was waging war elsewhere,Yudhisthira asked Abhimanyu to break the enemy’s lotus formation and assured him that they would enter behind him and help him find his way out.Unfortunately,Abhimanyu entered the lotus formation,and before the others could join him,the breach in the formation was closed.Hence,Abhimanyu who was equal to his father in skill and valour was trapped inside the enemy’s ranks.He fought bravely and defeated all the Kaurava heroes with ease.But then all the Kaurava heroes attacked him jointly and they killed him through cheap guerrilla tactics.<br></p>
