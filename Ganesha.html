                    <h2>The Birth and childhood</h2>
               </header>

               <p> Ganesha is one of the most distinctive Hindu deities with his large elephant head and pot-bellied human body. He plays a dual role of a supreme being powerful enough to remove obstacles and ensure success or create obstructions for those whose ambition has become destructive.</p>
               <p>Ganesha is an archetype who you might call upon when you’re about to embark on a new endeavor. As the Remover of Obstacles and the god of success, Ganesha is honored throughout Indian and in Hindu cultures, at both secular and religious ceremonies. When someone launches a new business or moves into a new home, for example, the elephant-headed god is invoked to bless the venture.</p>
               <p> The Hindu tradition contains many different versions of Ganesha’s origins. Some stories say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head. Most say that he was born with a human head that was later replaced with the elephant head.</p>
               <p>He is shown holding a broken tusk in his lower right hand like a pen, perhaps symbolizing the sacrifice he made in feverishly writing the Mahabharata. Another interpretation of the broken tusk is that it’s a symbol of the truth that outward imperfections have nothing to do with inner perfection.Ganesha is typically the first deity contacted in prayers in Hinduism. Those who seek wisdom and prosperity often call for him.</p>
               <p>While Ganesha is popularly considered to be the son of Shiva and Parvati, the Puranic myths relate several different versions of his birth.These include versions in which he is created by Shiva,by Parvati,by Shiva and Parvati,[10] or in a mysterious manner that is later discovered by Shiva and Parvati.</p>

<p>The family includes his brother Skanda, kartikeya.Regional differences dictate the order of their births. In North India, Skanda is generally said to be the elder brother while in the South, Ganesha is considered the first born. Prior to the emergence of Ganesha, Skanda had a long and glorious history as an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE, when his worship declined significantly in North India. The period of this decline is concurrent with the rise of Ganesha. Several stories relate episodes of sibling rivalry between Ganesha and Skanda and may reflect historical tensions between the respective sects</p>

<p>Once there was a competition between Ganesha and his brother as to see who could circumambulate the three worlds faster and hence win the fruit of knowledge. Skanda went off on a journey to cover the three worlds while Ganesha simply circumambulated his parents. When asked why he did so, he answered that his parents Shiva and Parvati constituted the three worlds and was thus given the fruit of knowledge.</p>
